    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "______________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "INTEGER: These are integer values, numbers with no decimal points\n",
    "\n",
    "REAL: This is similar to a Float value in python, numbers with decimal points\n",
    "\n",
    "TEXT: This is similar to a sting in python \n",
    "\n",
    "BLOB: Exactly as it sounds, a 'blob' of data that is stored exactly as it was input. For instance, if we stored an image in a SQLite database, it would be stored as a BLOB, and would not be touched or changed in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "A primary key is the key that you connect to another table with in a join, it is the unique value. A foreign key is also a key you can connect to another table with in a join, but it is not the unique value for that table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "One-to-One: one join using the same key that is present in both tables\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-Many: example: Class table and a Student table that we could use to store a class roster. Since one class can have many students, this would be a one-to-many relationship, that would be created by giving the Student records a foreign key column that would reference the primary key of the class they are enrolled in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-Many:  complex, because we can have an arbitrary number of records on either side of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Inner Join: Combines the common items\n",
    "Left Join: Combines all items in the first table + common items in the 2nd table\n",
    "Right Join: Combines all items in the second table + common items in the 1st table\n",
    "Outer Join: Combines all items from both tables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Aggregate functions are used to compute things like a COUNT or a MEAN. These functions perform these calculations on a 'group' that we must specify. For instance, assume we have a table containing the population for each country in the world, for each year in the last 20 years. If we wanted to get the mean of the population column, this could mean two different things. Without a GROUP BY statement, the SQL server would not know if we meant the mean population of a country across all 20 years, or the mean population of all countries for each given year. Both are mean values, and one is not more correct than the other, so the SQL server would throw an error because of the ambiguity. To make this work, we would need to specify whether we wanted the mean when the data is grouped by country (which would return the mean population over the 20 year span) or grouped by year (which would return the mean population of the average country for each of the separate years).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Associative Entities, also called JOIN Tables, are a type of table used to allow us to perform many-to-many JOINs. These tables act as a list that keep track of each of the different connections between an entity in one table and all of that entity's connections in another table. While we can JOIN tables directly for one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, we must use an Associative Entity in order to pull of a JOIN between two tables with a many-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
